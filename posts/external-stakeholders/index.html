&ldquo;When is Stripe going to IPO?&rdquo; Personally, I haven&rsquo;t the faintest clue, and from there
the conversation moved towards Silicon Valley&rsquo;s fascination with Stripe.
Stripe does a lot of things well, and deserves credit for all of that, but
I think the hardest thing that it does is often underappreciated:
it manages to innovate quickly <em>despite</em> having a vast number of external stakeholders.</p><p>My experience is that at B2C companies,
your loudest stakeholders are probably your users, your investors, and then your employees.
Conversely, at B2B companies it&rsquo;s probably enterprise users, investors, non-enterprise users,
and then employees.
Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s just the baseline for B2B. If you&rsquo;re in a highly regulated industry like finance,
integrating with numerous financial partners,
working internationally across an increasingly large number of countries,
and doing it while each of thoes countries is reimagining data privacy and data locality every six months&mldr;
that gets hard.</p><p>Stripe has retained its ability to ship new product despite the immense pressure from
their external stakeholders, and in my opinion that&rsquo;s their biggest accomplishment
as a scaled business. This complements their key insights at previous scaling points:
eengineers are the only stakeholder that matter at small startups, and
platform switching costs are commensurate with a platform&rsquo;s capabilities.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-grey bottom-0 pa3 tc" role=contentinfo><a class="f4 fw4 no-underline black-50 dn dib-ns pv2 ph4" href=https://sketches.lethain.com>&copy; Will Larson 2021</a>
