Velocity: experiments, explorations, investments
What are indicators
Small innovations Large innovations &amp;ndash; new fields, new products
What accelerates velocity
Developer workflows: check in, code review, test, deploy Stability: little time on failures, including reverts, etc Training Hiring Retention
What accelerates innovation?
Platforms Networks Users Brand Infrastructure
Misaligned incentives around resourcing/investment prevent innovation Innovator’s dilemma &amp;amp; solution It’s easy to innovate into high-margin products that draft on core biz Feature-teams can’t innovate Escaping the build trap Empowered Then let’s assume you do those, then Innovation comes from ?</description></item></channel></rss>
