A few folks mentioned the Fieldstone writing technique by Weinsberg. I’ve enjoyed Weinsberg’s other books, like “Being a technical leader” and “Secrets of a consultant”, so I decided to give it a read.
You can summarize the Fieldstone writing technique as: (1) collect related ideas in a file, (2) write stuff that energizes you, (3) switch projects to wherever you have the most energy.</description></item><item><title>Innovation</title><link>https://sketches.lethain.com/posts/innovation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 19:16:28 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://sketches.lethain.com/posts/innovation/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Why can&amp;rsquo;t we do this in an hour?&amp;rdquo;
Velocity: experiments, explorations, investments
What are indicators
Small innovations Large innovations &amp;ndash; new fields, new products
What accelerates velocity
Developer workflows: check in, code review, test, deploy Stability: little time on failures, including reverts, etc Training Hiring Retention
What accelerates innovation?
Platforms Networks Users Brand Infrastructure
Misaligned incentives around resourcing/investment prevent innovation Innovator’s dilemma &amp;amp; solution It’s easy to innovate into high-margin products that draft on core biz Feature-teams can’t innovate Escaping the build trap Empowered Then let’s assume you do those, then Innovation comes from ?</description></item></channel></rss>
