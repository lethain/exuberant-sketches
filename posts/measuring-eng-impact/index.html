At today&rsquo;s engineering leader breakfast (an extremely virtual breakfast, these days), we chatted about measuring engineering impact, which is quite different from measuring engineering velocity, even though velocity is a major input into impact.
Velocity metrics are the sort of things that you probably want to use to understand rather than to grade outcomes. Impact metrics should be things that you can grade against performance."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.81.0"><meta name=ROBOTS content="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/dist/main.css_5c99d70a7725bacd4c701e995b969fea.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/sketches.css><meta property="og:title" content="Measuring Eng Impact"><meta property="og:description" content="This became Measures of engineering impact.
