A few folks mentioned the Fieldstone writing technique by Weinsberg. I’ve enjoyed Weinsberg’s other books, like “Being a technical leader” and “Secrets of a consultant”, so I decided to give it a read.
You can summarize the Fieldstone writing technique as: (1) collect related ideas in a file, (2) write stuff that energizes you, (3) switch projects to wherever you have the most energy.</description></item><item><title>An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management</title><link>https://sketches.lethain.com/books/elegant-puzzle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 19:16:28 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://sketches.lethain.com/books/elegant-puzzle/</guid><description>An Elegant Puzzle was my first book, published May, 2019.

There are just so many management situations that push you to look at them through an ethical perspective.
A few of the situations that I’ve personally been in:
Senior technical leader ordering you to pull a candidate’s offer after they’d already given notice at their previous job due to an awkward conversation.</description></item><item><title>101 Ways to Increase Developer Productivity</title><link>https://sketches.lethain.com/books/101-ways-developer-productivity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 19:16:28 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://sketches.lethain.com/books/101-ways-developer-productivity/</guid><description>Yeah, just like, 101 ways you could improve your and your team&amp;rsquo;s developer productivity.

As more folks have started to read my work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how to find a home for the sorts of content that I enjoy writing but which are too unedited and rough to share with readers who expect writing to be written for them as opposed for for me.</description></item></channel></rss>
