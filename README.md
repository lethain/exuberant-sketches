This is a Hugo website, whose source is at https://github.com/lethain/exuberant-sketches,
and hosted at https://sketches.lethain.com. If you see a typo or have a suggestion,

This repository automatically redeploys on commit to `main`.

If you're on OSX, to run:

    git clone git@github.com:lethain/exuberant-sketches.git
    cd exuberant-sketches
    brew install hugo
    hugo serve -D

Then it should be fine.

It uses [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io) for CSS, entirely
because that is what the [Hugo Anake theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) uses.
