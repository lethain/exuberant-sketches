When folks asks if I’ll write another book after _An Elegant Puzzle_, I sometimes joke that if I wrote another management book it would be An Ethical Profession, and I could refer to them as AEP1 and AEP2. There are just so many management situations that push you to look at them through an ethical perspective.

A few of the situations that I’ve personally been in:

* Senior technical leader ordering you to pull a candidate’s offer after they’d already given notice at their previous job due to an awkward conversation.
* Asking someone to leave less than a month after they start due to conflict with their team.
* A previous coworker interviewing, and taking their own life two days after receiving their rejection notice.
* Hiring folks who will be highly impactful for next year, knowing they’re unlikely to keep pace as role grows.

Some of the content I've written that I think might fit into this book
(and which isn't already published in _Staff Engineer_ or _Elegant Puzzle_):

If I ever make progress on [Infrastructure Engineering Book](/books/infra-eng-book), some of this
content could conceivably go there, but who knows.
