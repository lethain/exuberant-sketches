I'm [Will Larson](https://lethain.com/about/), and I've been
writing on my blog, [Irrational Exuberance](https://lethain.com/all-posts/)
for over a decade, in addition to a couple longer form writing projects,
_[Staff Engineer](http://staffeng.com)_ and _[An Elegant Puzzle](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/)_.
As more folks have started to read my work, [I've been thinking about how to find a home](http://lethain.com/exuberant-sketches)
for the sorts of content that I enjoy writing but which are too unedited and rough to share with readers who
expect writing to be written *for them* as opposed for *for me*.

This is _Exuberant Sketches_, my [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden),
where I write and collect random things without any attention to readers.

I'll continue to write edited, structured content on [Irrational Exuberance](https://lethain.com).
