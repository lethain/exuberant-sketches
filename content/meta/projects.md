**Some of these links point to private google docs, which is how I used to manage my personal wiki. I will migrate them at some point, but don't hold your breath!**

Some potential projects to play with at some point

* [Cue app](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u29S86j_OoeHZZyY8ZVh8uqAev-5NWUdTSc2WtXKTJg/edit#)
* “Reachable” / Webhook Dashboard: Ephemeral and persistent queues; HTTP/2 replay; HTTP/1 long-poll or quick response
* Solve the “can’t open hole in firewall” problem
* “Code hotspot finder” recommend sections of a repository to improve for productivity purposes, could even recommend files to split apart, etc!
