At today's engineering leader breakfast (an extremely virtual breakfast, these days),
we chatted about measuring engineering impact, which is quite different from measuring
engineering velocity, even though velocity is a major input into impact.

Velocity metrics are the sort of things that you probably want to use to *understand* rather
than to *grade* outcomes. Impact metrics should be things that you *can* grade against performance.

A few fascinating notes on how other companies do this:

* Amazon: # press releases
* Square: # new billable features
* Gusto: # competitive advantages created, # competitive accelerants, # table stake features

At Calm I've been thinking about this too.  We've been using:

* \# big bets, these are new, differentiated features
* \# experiments (with a target distribution for winning, neutral, and losing outcomes)
* \# fires (not trying to drive this to zero, rather learning from its fluxuations)
* 1-2 technical investments: we don't want to incentivize numerous tech-driven technical changes, but we also want to avoid starving out innovation, so we specify a fixed target

This has been working out pretty well so far.
